<h1>Are the expected outcomes of Riot: League of Legends’ champion statistics occurring for each gameplay patch implementation?</h1>
  <div class="maintext">
  <p class="m">In Riot: League of Legends, there are 151 playable champions. 
    There are 5 champions picked for each team and 5 champions banned for each team. 
    Champions can only be picked 1 time per game played among 2 teams. 
    Champions can be banned 1 time per team per game which can add up to 2 times per game. 
    Some champions are stronger than others which leads to a variety of win-rates, pick-rates, and ban-rates among them. </p>
  <p class="m">When champions become too strong or are too weak, Riot makes patch changes to attempt to balance champion statistics across all skill levels. 
    These patch changes reflect differing win-rates among the champions affected. 
    Champions that receive an increase, or “buff”, to their statistics are expected to have a higher win-rate percentage than the previous patch and vice versa to champions who receive a decrease, or “nerf”, to their stats. 
    These win-rates are reflective of their patch changes, pick-rates, and total games played.

  <div>
  <p class="m">In Riot: League of Legends, there are 151 playable champions. 
    There are 5 champions picked for each team and 5 champions banned for each team. 
    Champions can only be picked 1 time per game played among 2 teams. 
    Champions can be banned 1 time per team per game which can add up to 2 times per game. 
    Some champions are stronger than others which leads to a variety of win-rates, pick-rates, and ban-rates among them. </p>
  <p class="m">When champions become too strong or are too weak, Riot makes patch changes to attempt to balance champion statistics across all skill levels. 
    These patch changes reflect differing win-rates among the champions affected. 
    Champions that receive an increase, or “buff”, to their statistics are expected to have a higher win-rate percentage than the previous patch and vice versa to champions who receive a decrease, or “nerf”, to their stats. 
    These win-rates are reflective of their patch changes, pick-rates, and total games played.

  <h2>Buffed & Nerfed Champion's Win Rate for Patch 10.18 & 10.19</h2>
  <div class="WinRate"></div>
    <p class="m">Win-rate is the first statistic to consider if the champion’s buff or nerf was actually affected as this reflects in the gameplay. 
      A champion experiencing a <span style = "color:blue;">buff</span> (blue dot) should see an increase in win-rate while a <span style = "color:red;">nerf</span> (red dot) should cause a decrease in win-rate. 
      One champion’s (Udyr) win-rate appears to drop due to an increase in total games played. 
      This can be explained by a lack of experience in players attempting to play the champion simply because they received a buff. </p>
  </div>
    
  <div id="Graph2" class="tabcontent">
  <h2>Buffed & Nerfed Champion's Pick Rate for Patch 10.18 & 10.19</h2>
  <div class="PickRate"></div>
    <p class="m">Pick-rate is an important statistic to consider as it reflects the communities opinion on if a character has increased in viability in the meta. 
      A champion experiencing a <span style = "color:blue;">buff</span> should see an increase in pick-rate while a <span style = "color:red;">nerf</span> should cause a decrease in pick-rate. 
      The nerfed champion (Fiora) that had an opposite effect compared to what was expected had negligible change and could be attributed to that champion’s higher total number of games.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="Graph3" class="tabcontent">
  <h2>Buffed & Nerfed Champion's Games Played for Patch 10.18 & 10.19</h2>
  <div class="TotalGames"></div>
    <div class = "test">
      <p class="m">The total number of games played is an important factor regarding the players’ thoughts on the patch changes. 
        The new meta spawns a change in total games played based on the <span style = "color:blue;">buff</span> which results in a higher expected number of total games played compared to a <span style = "color:red;">nerf</span> that expects a lower total number of games played. 
        The nerfed champion (Fiora) that had an opposite effect compared to what was expected displayed a higher pick-rate as well compared to the patch before her nerf.</p>

    <h2>Conclusions</h2>
    <p>In conclusion, the statistic to pay close attention to would be the win-rate. 
      This may be an area where a champion has received too much of a buff or too much of a nerf. 
      However, these also may be areas where the inconsistency of players alter the statistics. 
      As stated earlier, Udyr’s win-rate drops due to an increase in total games played. 
      Seeing a champion with a buff deems
